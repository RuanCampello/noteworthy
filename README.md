## Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Authentication**: NextAuth

## Design Inspiration

A significant portion of Noteworthy's UI design is inspired by the Figma community file [Nowted](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1188856976000269208/nowted-a-note-taking-app).

## Backend Architecture

Noteworthy's backend is built with Next.js server actions, Neon, and Drizle:

- **Next.js Server Actions**: Server-side logic is handled using Next.js server actions, providing efficient and scalable backend functionality.
- **Neon**: A serverless PostgreSQL database, Neon offers a powerful and flexible data storage solution for Noteworthy's backend operations.
- **Drizzle**: Drizzle serves as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) layer, providing fast and efficient database interactions while ensuring data integrity and security.

Forms across Noteworthy, including those for authentication and other user interactions, are validated using Zod, providing robust validation and ensuring data integrity.

Additionally, users' profile images are stored on Cloudflare R2, offering a secure and scalable solution for image storage.

## Features

### 1. Intuitive Interface

- Enjoy a clean and user-friendly interface for an effortless note-taking experience.

### 2. Server Components

- Utilise server components to render and hydrate components on the server, optimising performance and reducing client-side bundle size.

### 3. Note Management

- **Create Note**: Create a new note using pre-created colours and providing a name.
- **Favourite/Unfavourite Note**: Easily mark notes as favourites or remove them from favourites.
- **Archive/Unarchive Note**: Archive notes to keep your workspace clutter-free, and unarchive them when needed.
- **Search Notes**: Quickly find specific notes using the search functionality.
- **Filter Notes**: Filter notes by title alphabetically, by creation time (newest or oldest), or by update time (last update first), with the default filter being by update time.

> [!NOTE]
> A note cannot be archived and favourited at the same time; it's either one or none.

### 4. Dictionary

- **Word Definitions and Phonetics**: Look up definitions and phonetic transcriptions of words.
- **Word Pronunciation**: Audio pronunciations to help users learn the correct pronunciation.
- **Synonyms and Antonyms**: View synonyms and antonyms to enhance vocabulary.
- **Examples with Selected Words**: Display example sentences using the selected word for context.

## Authentication

Authentication in Noteworthy is powered by [NextAuth](https://authjs.dev/), supporting multiple authentication providers including:

- **Credentials (Email and Password)**: Users can sign up and log in using their email and password. The "forgot password" feature allows users to reset their password securely.
- **GitHub OAuth**: Users can authenticate using their GitHub account.
- **Google OAuth**: Users can authenticate using their Google account.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The authentication system is immutable, ensuring that users cannot log in with the same email using different authentication methods.

## Note editor functionality

The note editor functionality in Noteworthy is powered by [Tiptap](https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap), a headless editor. Customized by me, it offers the following features:

- **Text Style**: Choose from heading levels (1 to 4) or paragraphs.
- **Font Family**: Select from 6 available fonts, including Garamond, Montserrat, Lobster, Didot, Merriweather, and Source Sans 3 (default).
- **Font Size**: Change the font size using pre-selected values, with the default set to 12px.
- **Alignment**: Align text to left, center, right, or justify, with the default alignment set to left.
- **Text Formatting**: Format text with options to bold, Italicise, underline, strike, highlight, superscript, or subscript.

## Installation

To run Noteworthy locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/RuanCampello/noteworthy.git
   cd noteworthy
   ```

2. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine. If not, follow the installation instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. Build and start the services using Docker Compose:

   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build # or docker compose up --build
   ```

5. **Open your web browser** and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> OAuth, Password Reset and Profile Image Uploads: In the development environment, OAuth authentication, password reset mailer and profile image updates are disabled. OAuth requires GitHub and Google environment variables, which are not set in the Docker environment. Image uploads use Cloudflare environment variables, which are also not set in Docker. So do Resend.

## Internationalisation (i18n) Support

Noteworthy supports multiple languages, allowing users to switch between languages seamlessly.

### Supported Languages

- English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§
- Portuguese (BR) ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·

### How to Switch Languages

You can switch the language of the application using the language selector available in settings. The language files are stored in the public/locales directory, and the translations are managed via cookies using next-intl.

### To add a new language, follow these steps:

Create a new folder in the public/locales directory with the language name in English (e.g. spanish, Dutch).
Add translation JSON files (translations.json) in the new folder with the necessary translations.
Update the locales.ts file at `src/lib/next-inlt/locales.ts` to include the new language in the locales array.
